# SCRIPTING CHALLENEGE
Something that is essential to anyone in tech, regardless of what their role is, is scripting skills. I want you to select a scripting language of your preference, preferably something you can use daily with the current systems you support. This challenege is designed to test your scripting skills. Its designed to indroduce a fundamental technique for parsing logs or finding specific information, think low level search engine.

### NOTE: 
Because you are learning, please avoid use of AI with this. Do as much as you can on your own. If you get stuck, ASK FOR HELP!

## THE GOAL:
- The goal of this script is to search through each object (name) in the "list_of_names.txt" file/
- Add output text in the terminal if a name that doesnt equal Aaron, John, or Karman is on the list.
- Export a list of strange names to a text file in your "results" folder.

## BONUS POINTS (Optional):
- Add smart logic to identify failures or irregularities in the listed objects (try/catch, invalid values).
- Add output text when the script begins, ends, and if a strange object is identified.
- Add a formatted date to the output file name.
- Add notes to each line of code explaining what they do
- Push the code to your personal GitHub

## PRO TIPS:
- Choose which ever scripting language you feel most comfortable with and can use right now in your current position. 
    - PowerShell, bash, or Javascript would be my recommendations based on what I know about your current team, but pick what ever language you want =)
- A ForEach Loop will be your friend here.
- Be mindful of where your output text is placed in the code
- IF an unexpected name is found, output text; ELSE, do nothing. "hint, hint"
- Google is your best friend. If these sites pop up they will have some of the best information for what you are trying to accomplish: (Microsoft, StackOverflow, and Google Docs)
